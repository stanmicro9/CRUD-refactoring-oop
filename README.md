# CRUD-refactoring-oop
This website is designed as a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using HTML and JavaScript, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for a clean and organized structure. Users can easily manage a collection of products stored in local storage, where each product includes a name, description, price, and category.

## Key Features:
* Product Management: Users can create new products by filling out a well-organized form that captures essential details like name, description, price, and category.
* Data Storage: All product information is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing for persistent data management without the need for a backend.
* Update Functionality: Users can select existing products to update their details, ensuring the list stays current.
* Delete Option: Each product can be removed easily, keeping the inventory streamlined.
* User-Friendly Interface: The design prioritizes usability, with clear form layouts and intuitive navigation, making product management straightforward for users of all skill levels.

This implementation not only demonstrates the application of OOP concepts in JavaScript but also provides a practical solution for managing product inventories effectively.
